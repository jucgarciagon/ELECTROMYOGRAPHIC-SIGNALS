# Electromyographic Signals
The process carried out for the development of a system for the acquisition, processing, and communication of the information of an electromyographic signal, produced in the contraction of the muscle in the forearm due to the action of gripping the hand; this signal is captured by an amplifier system (muscle sensor AT-04-001 of MyoWare) and processed through the development of an algorithm in the pic18f2550, carried out under the implementation of the mathematical tool called discrete wavelet transform (WTD).
